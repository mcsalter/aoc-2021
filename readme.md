# Advent of code 2021:

repo used to store my code for advent of code 2021

(you won't find me on the leaderboards, not one for speeding through a project)

This is going to be written in c++ for the majority of the days. 
If you want to copy the code, you will need to compile yourself, use `g++` I'm sure you know how :)

```Makefile
g++ day[x].cpp -Wall -Werror -std=c++20
```
